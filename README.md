# Neural Style Transfer
In this project, we use an image recognition neural network to transfer the style of one image to another.

You can use the [Jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gregory-m-mullen/neural_style_transfer/blob/master/style_transfer_adapted_octaves.ipynb) file to try the process with two images of your choosing (it runs in Colab). The notebook is an adapted version of [this notebook](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/nst_blogpost/4_Neural_Style_Transfer_with_Eager_Execution.ipynb), which provides more discussion of the machinery of the neural style transfer program. I tried to simplify the notebook to make it plug and play. Anyone should be able to run it using their own content and style images without changing any of the code. I also added a few features to facilitate running the process in an interative fashion using scaled images, which tends to produce more impressive results.

Examples of style transferred images that I made are shown in the [examples folder](https://github.com/gregory-m-mullen/neural_style_transfer/tree/master/examples). Each subfolder shows the adapted images along with their representative style and content images.
